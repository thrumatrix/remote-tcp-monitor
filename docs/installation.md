## 3. TCPv Service (Agent Component)

**TCPv Service** is a core agent responsible for collecting TCP and UDP connection data from remote hosts. It supports both **automatic deployment** and **manual installation**, depending on your network environment.

### üîÑ Automatic Installation

When registering a client:

- If the **"Lightweight Connection"** option is **not selected**, the TCPv service will be **automatically installed** on the remote computer.
- No user intervention is required.

### üîî Local Update Prompt

If an outdated version of TCPv service is detected on the local machine:

- The system will prompt the user to update when initiating local monitoring.
- **UAC confirmation** is required to proceed.

---

### üõ† Manual Installation

Manual installation is recommended for:

- Cross-subnet or Internet hosts
- Devices behind firewalls or with restricted network access
- Environments with third-party antivirus or strict policies

#### üìÅ Step 1: Copy the Service Executable

Copy `tcpvsvc.exe` from the local installation path to any accessible folder on the target computer.

**Typical source paths:**

- **Win32 App**  
  ```
  C:\Program Files\Remote TCP Monitor Aio\ort\services\tcpvsvc.exe
  ```

- **UWP App**  
  *(Replace `5.0.379.0` with the actual version number)*  
  - **Standard Edition**  
    ```
    C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\29910XieShidong.RemoteTCPMonitor_5.0.379.0_x64__02gh7fjn484g8\ORT\services\tcpvsvc.exe
    ```
  - **Pro Edition**  
    ```
    C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\29910XieShidong.RemoteTCPMonitorPro_5.0.379.0_x64__02gh7fjn484g8\ORT\services\tcpvsvc.exe
    ```
  - **Trial Edition**  
    ```
    C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\29910XieShidong.RemoteTCPMonitorTrial_5.0.379.0_x64__02gh7fjn484g8\ORT\services\tcpvsvc.exe
    ```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Run Installation Command

On the target computer, open **Command Prompt as Administrator**, then run:

```
tcpvsvc.exe -is
```

To uninstall the service, run:

```
tcpvsvc.exe -u
```

### ‚úÖ When to Use Manual Installation

Manual deployment is ideal when:

- Automatic installation is blocked by security software
- Remote access policies prevent agent push
- You require controlled, auditable deployment steps

Ensure the TCPv service is running properly to enable full monitoring capabilities.
